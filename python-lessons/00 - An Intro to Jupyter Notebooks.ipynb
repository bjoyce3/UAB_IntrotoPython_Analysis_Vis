A pair of curly braces, `{` and `}`, is used to group text together so that the statement `i=1` becomes the the subscript and `N` becomes the superscript. Similarly, `-i` is in curly braces to make the whole statement the superscript for `2`. `\\sum` and `\\approx` are latex commands for “sum over” and “approximate” symbols.\n",
